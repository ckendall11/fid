    <h1>Chris Kendall</h1>
<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
<p>I served 5 years in the U.S. Marine Corps as a Special Intelligence Systems Administrator/Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Operator working with satellite communications/networking/information security and a slew of other technologies. Upon completion of active duty, I moved on to the civilian sector working as a Storage Engineer for NetApp. After several years I became a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) Administrator for Boeing, and later a Storage Engineer at Bank of America. I now work as a Technical Account Manager for a software company dealing with active-active replication and disaster planning/recovery. Currently I am completing a Digital Media degree with a focus on game development and graphic design, granting me a unique combination of skills that set me apart as an aspiring Technical Artist.</p>
